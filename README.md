<b>Gallery Project</b>

This project was created as a way for me to stretch my website building skills, and really understand what goes into choosing what frameworks work best for different projects.
It helped build my understanding of how a backend interacts with a frontend. It also helped solidify my skills in using CSS and javascript to build a given design.

Next.js was chosen to have a dynamic frontend, as well as a lightweight front end that is easy to spin up and get started. I could have gone with using a large JSON file to mimic
the kind of database, but I wanted to learn how to start a database from groundup. For this, using Rails through an API was chosen for the backend. I could learn to use API calls, and 
have a more extensive database that was still lightweight.

<b>Installation Instructions </b>

Have Node 20 installed, Rails 7 installed, and Ruby 3.1.0

<b>Spin up Instructions</b>

In front-end directory, use <i>npm run dev</i> and visit http:localhost:3000/ to view frontend.
